# Habitica API OpenAPI specification

This is a fork from https://github.com/igromanru/habitica-api

The original schema file with bak extension was separated into spec directory using the command below.
```
npx @redocly/cli split openapi.yaml --outDir=spec
```

Here's the Habitica V3 API Documentation
