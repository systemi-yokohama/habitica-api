  summary: Change the class of the authenticated user
  description: >
    User must be at least level 10. \

    If "class" is defined and user.flags.classSelected is false it'll change the
    class. \

    If user.preferences.disableClasses it'll enable classes, otherwise it sets
    user.flags.classSelected to false (costs 3 gems). \

    See: [ApiDoc](https://habitica.com/apidoc/#api-User-UserChangeClass)
